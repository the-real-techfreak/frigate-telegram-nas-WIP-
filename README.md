# frigate-telegram-nas

This repo is created for installing and setting up Frigate NVR, enable an automation to save the frigate "review" clips (Review -> compilation of simultaneous events) in a particular folder and then send this clip to the user through Telegram Bot - Send Video service. Please note that as of Frigate 0.17, the API doesn't allow for a compiled clip for each review item but individual event clips can be called.
